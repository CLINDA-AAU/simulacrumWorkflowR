simulacrumR is a package developed to assist users of the Simulacrum dataset in better preparing to use the dataset as a precursor to accessing real patient data in the Cancer Administration System (CAS).

The Simulacrum data is a synthetic version of the real patient data at CAS. It is publicly available and can be used to create and test analyses in R or STATA before executing them on the real data. However, setting up Simulacrum requires creating a local Oracle database, importing the data, and setting up an ODBC connection. To simplify this process, the simulacrumR package automates the setup of a database within R and provides various utility functions for preprocessing, query generation, and query testing.

# Installation
simulacrumR may be installed using the following command:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CLINDA-AAU/simulacrumR",
dependencies = TRUE, force = TRUE) 

```

# Overview
The main functions of simulacrumR is: 

- Integrated SQL Environment: Leverages the SQLdf (Grothendieck, 2017) package to enable SQL queries directly within R, eliminating the need for external database setup and ODBC connections by creating a local SQLite temporary database within the R environment.  

- Query Helper: Offers a collection of queries custom-made for the Simulacrum, for pulling and merging certain tables. Additionally, does the sqlite2oracle function assist in translating queries to be compatible with the NHS servers. 

- Helper Tools: Offers a range of data preprocessing functions for cleaning, and preparing the data for analysis, ensuring data quality and consistency. Key functions include cancer type grouping, survival status, and detailed logging.  

- Workflow Generator: Generates an R script with the complete workflow. Ensuring correct layout and the ability to integrate all the necessary code to obtain a workflow suitable for submission to the NHS and execution on the CAS database.  

# The process 
The process of using this package for getting access to the data at CAS through Simulacrum is as following: 

1) Download the latest version of Simulacrum at: https://simulacrum.healthdatainsight.org.uk/using-the-simulacrum/requesting-data/

2) Copy the directory path of the Simulacrum files on your local machine

3) Use the package's data loader function to load the files into R 

4) Utilize R to handle data preprocessing and analysis 

5) Save the complete workflow with the workflow generator function 

6) Send the Workflow to NHS and wait for the results

## Explanation of the workflow
The workflow is built around the SQLdf package where the user are able to setup a invisible database in the span of seconds and fully automated. Before the database is intialised, the user is required to download the latest version of the Simulacrum (v2.1.0) data: https://simulacrum.healthdatainsight.org.uk/using-the-simulacrum/requesting-data/ .

The latest Simulacrum data is formatted identically to the real CAS data. Once downloaded, the read_simulacrum() function can automatically load the CSV files as data frames in R:

```{r}
library(simulacrumR)

dir <- "C:/Users/p90j/Desktop/Jakob/Data/Simulacrum/simulacrum_v2.1.0/Data/"
# Automated data loading 
data_frames_lists <- read_simulacrum(dir, selected_files = c("sim_av_patient", "sim_av_tumour")) 
```

Access individual data frames as follows:

```{r}
SIM_AV_PATIENT <- data_frames_lists$sim_av_patient
SIM_AV_TUMOUR <- data_frames_lists$sim_av_tumour
```

Once data frames are loaded, you can start writing queries. It's recommended to keep queries simple and handle data management in R. Use the table_query_list function to access premade query templates. For example, to merge tables:
```{r}
query <- "SELECT *
FROM SIM_AV_PATIENT
INNER JOIN SIM_AV_TUMOUR ON SIM_AV_PATIENT.patientid = SIM_AV_TUMOUR.patientid;"
```


Execute queries with the sql_test() function:

```{r}
df1 <- sql_test(query)
```
## SQLite to Oracle Query Translation

To accommodate differences between SQLite and Oracle queries, use the sqlite2oracle() function:

```{r}

query2 <- "select *
from SIM_AV_PATIENT
where age > 50
limit 500;"

sqlite2oracle(query2)
```

## Preprocessing Functions

simulacrumR includes functions to simplify data preprocessing:

- 'cancer_grouping'()
- 'group_ethnicity()'
- 'extended_summary()'
- 'survival_days()'

## Workflow Generation

When data management and analysis are complete, use the workflow generator function to produce an R script ready for submission to the NHS:

```{r}
create_workflow(
                             libraries = "library(dplyr)",
                             query = "select * 
                             from SIM_AV_PATIENT
                             where age > 50
                             limit 500;",
                             data_management = "
                             # Run query on SQLite database
                              cancer_grouping(sim_av_tumour)

                              # Additional preprocessing
                              #df2 <- survival_days(df1)
                              ",
                             analysis = "model = glm(x ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data=data)",
                             model_results = "html_table_model(model)")
```

This workflow automates the process, ensuring easy integration and preparation of your Simulacrum data.

In the event of an error on NHS servers while executing the analysis pipeline, the `time_management` function and the base R `sink` will generate a comprehensive log to facilitate seamless debugging.
