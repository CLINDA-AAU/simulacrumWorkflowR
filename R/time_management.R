#' Compute and Check Execution Time Against a Limit
#'
#' @description
#' Calculates the execution time between given start and end times and checks if it exceeds a 3-hour limit.
#' Returns a message indicating whether the execution time was within the limit or exceeded it.
#'
#' @details
#' This time calculation function is implemented in the package because there is a 3-hour time limit for running analyses on NHS servers.
#' To help users estimate the runtime of their analyses, this function can be incorporated into their code.
#'
#' To use this function, place two time variable functions, `start_time()` and `end_time()`, which are `POSIXct` objects, 
#' at the beginning and end of your script, respectively. You can also use these functions to 
#' test the runtime of specific sections of your script. This function uses the `lubridate` package 
#' to calculate the time difference.
#'
#' The function provides messages to inform the user whether the 3-hour runtime has been exceeded.
#'
#' A warning message reminds users that analysis times on local machines and NHS servers are likely different.
#' However, even with potential time differences, the function provides a guide for time management and a reminder of the limitations of using NHS servers.
#'
#' @param start_time A `POSIXct` object representing the start time.
#' @param end_time A `POSIXct` object representing the end time.

#' @return A character vector containing the total execution time and the result (accepted or rejected).
#'         If the time exceeds 3 hours, a warning is issued.
